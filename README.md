# javascript-course-projects
Hi, I'm Dorotea! 

I'm currently expanding my skill set by diving into modern JavaScript through The Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann. My goal is to explore new technologies and shift my career toward more dynamic, hands-on development roles. Since JavaScript is at the heart of so many job opportunities today—from frontend frameworks to full-stack applications. 

I'm building this repository to document my learning, showcase my progress, and share the projects I’ve created along the way.

Each folder in this repo contains a standalone project that reflects a key concept or challenge from the course. I’m excited to keep growing and eventually contribute to real-world applications.
