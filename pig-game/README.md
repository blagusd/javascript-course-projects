This is a bit complicated game than Guess-My-Number! Up to two players.

Dices are rolling and score is accumulating. If 1 is thrown, player is switched, but - if user didn't press the 'Hold' button before rolling the 1, his accumulated score won't be stored.
Winner is one who scores 100 or more first!
